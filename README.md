# looping-through-numbers
Write a program that uses while loops to perform the following steps:  Promp the user to input two numbers firstNum and secondNum.  If firstNum is larger than secondNum, require the user to enter the numbers again.  Do not let the user continue without entering a firstNum less than the secondNum.  Output all the odd numbers between firstNum and secondNum (inclusive).  Output the sum of all the numbers between firstNum and secondNum (inclusive).  Here is a sample run:  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6rR7Y5qt4gZU096eTV6VDU5eEk/view?usp=sharing     The code reads in 2 and 7 from the user.  No print statements are made to prompt the user.  The code prints:  3 5 7  because those numbers are odd.  The code prints:  27  because that is the sum of all the numbers two through seven.
